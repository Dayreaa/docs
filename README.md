# XenForo Developer Documentation

Welcome to the developer documentation for XenForo.

The documentation is far from finished, but is still a good start to familiarise yourself with:

- Installing XF from the command line
- The add-on structure in XF
- Some concepts in XF including entities, finders and repositories
- A full tutorial to build your own portal add-on in XF

Please feel free to post any [issues](https://github.com/xenforo-ltd/docs/issues) you may find with the documentation. If you'd like to contribute changes to our documentation then you should first read our guidelines and other useful information [here](https://github.com/xenforo-ltd/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please also use the main [XenForo community](https://xenforo.com/community) for help with XF development, providing feedback on XenForo and reporting bugs with the software.
